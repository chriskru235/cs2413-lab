#include "graph.h"
// Description

// Write a function that counts how many nodes are isolated.
// A node is isolated if it has no edges connected to it.
// // The graph is stored as an adjacency matrix. 
// Graph* g is a pointer to a Graph struct, which contains a 2D array adj[MAX_NODES][MAX_NODES]. 
// The value at adj[u][v] is 1 if there is an edge between nodes u and v, and 0 otherwise.




int count_isolated(Graph* g) {
    int total = MAX_NODES;
    for(int u=0; u<MAX_NODES; u++)
        for(int v=0; v<MAX_NODES;v++)
            if(g->adj[u][v] == 1 && g->adj[v][u] == g->adj[u][v]) {
                total--;
                break;
            }
    return total;
}















// Tip: In the adjacency matrix, that means the entire row for that node contains only 0s.
